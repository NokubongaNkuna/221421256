This is what i undeestand about wed Development:
Web development is the process of coding a website to create the intended design using programming languages like CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Python, Ruby on Rails, and more. 
There are back-end developers who focus on the infrastructure of a site or web application (hosting, security, etc), there are front-end developers who focus on the functionality of the site/app, 
and there are full-stack developers that work on both front-end and back-end.
